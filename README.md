Code used in a presentation which was an introduction to machine learning.

To run this you will need to install python 3, create a virtual environment and install the required packages. Below it is described how to install Python 3. In short I would recommend following the instructions found here:

[Hitchhikers guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)

### Install Python 3.x
 
The [Hitchhikers guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) provides “both novice and expert Python developers a best practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis.” 
Mac and Linux users should follow instructions in this guide. 

Windows users, because installing Python and its packages can be tricky for you, I recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) package for the simplest install. 
If you want to, you can use the Windows instructions in the Hitchhiker’s Guide, 
but I have always used the Anaconda package.
